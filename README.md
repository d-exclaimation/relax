# `relax`


[`relax`](https://spotlight.d-exclaimation.me) is a multi-purpose [Slack](https://slack.com) built for my full-year project team management. 

> **Warning**
>
> Bot is currently only designed for my personal use, but feel free to use it as a template for your own bot.
>
> At some point, I will make it more generic and easier to use.


## Features

### Actions (Slash & Mention Commands)

<img width="100%" src="assets/reviewer-action.png">

`reviewer` - a random reviewer from the associated development team, take the stress out of choosing a reviewer, and let the bot do it for you.

<img width="100%" src="assets/quote-action.png">

`quote` - a random quote from a famous person, to inspire you to do your best.

  <i>
    Commands can be triggered by either slash commands or by mentioning using the format <code>@relax {command}</code>
  </i>

### Workflow Steps

`Pick a random reviewer` - similar to its action counterpart, but is integrated into Slack Workflow Builder, so you can use it in your own workflow.
